## Intro to HTML

Alright here's the fun part. We're going to learn about HTML, the "language" that powers the web. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the markup system that web browsers use to interpret and render web pages. HTML is really a superset of XML, which is a file format and markup language which is used to store and transport data.

### Setup

1. Clone the Git repository from GitHub: [stackunderflowclub/learn-html](https://github.com/stackunderflowclub/learn-html)
